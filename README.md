# Data-Engineer-Journey

## In this repository, I will be saving my DE roadmap, coursework, and helpful learning materials.

I am currently a Data Analyst, and most of my work revolves around gathering requirements, writing documentation, and creating ETL mapping logic for data engineers. I believe that taking on the task of learning data engineering will greatly improve my ability to contribute and will set me up if I ever want to move into data engineering in the future.
